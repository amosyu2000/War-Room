## About
War Room is an Android app created to assist in your daily prayers every day of the week. It was inspired out of my need for a convenient place to record prayer requests. War Room will generate a prayer list for each day of the week such that every week you will have prayed for everyone on your list at least twice.  

## Usage Guide
- The War Room homepage displays a verse of the day taken from [Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/reading-plans/verse-of-the-day/next?version=NIV). Tapping on the verse of the day will allow you to change the bible version.  
- Below the verse of the day is the list of your prayers for that day.

- Tapping on the drawer button in the top-left corner will open up your complete prayer list. Inside the drawer, you can add, edit, or remove prayer requests.

- Going back to the homepage, tapping on the calendar button in the top-right corner opens up your weekly prayer calendar. Here, you can view the prayer list of each day of the week.
